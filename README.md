# MDBCooker
MDBCooker is a bash script designed to search for a specific keyword within all tables of an MDB (Microsoft Access Database) file. It exports each table in the database to a CSV format and checks if the specified keyword is present. If a match is found, the table name is displayed; otherwise, the CSV file is deleted.
